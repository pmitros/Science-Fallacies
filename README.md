# What is this?

This is a web site for a session I am organizing for the April 2017
Day of Action at MIT. This session focuses on two topics: (1) How to
effect organizational change (2) Bad science.

# What is this session about?

Did you know that [Cambridge helped Trump win the
election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc)? Westboro
Babtist Church has done more to forward LGBT rights than most liberal
activists groups? Many attempts at activism have opposite of the
desired effect. We will briefly discuss how to work to effectively
influence organizational systems (whether government, corporate, or
otherwise) through both [hard
tactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs) and [soft
tactics](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034).

Concretely, we will focus on applying this to an area close to home --
bad science. According to
[Pew](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/public-views-on-climate-change-and-climate-scientists/),
roughly half of the US population does not believe in human-caused
climate change. The public has developed a healthy distrust of
science. Unfortunately, much of this skepticism is justified. Science,
especially as presented in K-12 classrooms, popular press, and popular
books, is [quite
often](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)
quite wrong. This undermines the credibility of science even when it
is right. We will work in small groups to explore some of the issues
in the scientific establishment, and try to come up with ways to
address them.

A [draft curriculum](http://www.sciencefallacies.org/) with
recommended pre-work is available. Session limited to 30 participants.

# Pre-work and References

Pre-work is not required but recommended. In particular, there are two
entertaining videos which might be helpful to watch before the
session. [This Video Will Make You
Angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc) discusses how
protests act to mobilize the opposition. [Rules for
Rulers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs) is a summary of
the (very excellent) [Dictator's
Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Dictators-Handbook-Behavior-Almost-Politics/dp/1610391845),
which gives a popular game-theoretic explanation of what is required
to come to and maintain power. Both of these fall under the category
of hard tactics.

Two good references for soft tactics include [Building
Relationships](http://morassociates.com/readings/MOR_Building_Relationships_Article.pdf)
from MOR Associates, an organization which specializes in leadership
training, and the classic book [How to Win Friends and Influence
People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034)

Broadly speaking, effective change tactics require understanding the
parties involved, their motivations, and predicting the effects of our
actions. Other good references include [Getting to
Yes](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352),
which focuses on how to understand the opposition, and come up with
solutions which meet the needs of all parties involved.

When reading these books, remember that changes often happen
behind-the-scenes. 

# Why should you attend this session?

In college at MIT, most of us had poor soft skills, and didn't really
get what soft skills were. MIT's training in soft skills was limited
to "communications intensive" courses and groupwork, which didn't
really do the job especially well.

This gap held me back (in the words of one mentor, as I was starting a
new organization, I was "like a bull in a chinashop"). Since
graduation, I have spent a lot of time trying to understand, both
theoretically and practically, how to effectively effect
organizational change.

I have been increasingly successful at this effort. I have been
involved in three initiatives as a co-founder or early employee. All
broke the $100 million mark. Through that journey, I learned much more
about soft skills required in the real world. I'd like to share some
of that knowledge. A few of the things I've done (like edX, which I
proposed to the provost of MIT in the early fall of 2011) resulted in
profound institutional changes. 

In that time, I have also become increasingly critical of the academic
establishment. In my half-decade experience as the Chief Scientist of
edX, I have experienced many shortcomings of academia and academic
research. I thought it'd be nice to run a session to see if we could
figure out how we might be able to work to effect positive change.

# Tentative Session Structure

* 15 minutes: Overview of session, overview of frameworks of
  organizational change
* 30 minutes: Break into groups. Each group prepares a 5 minute minute
  presentation about their problem
* 30 minutes: Group presentations
* 10 minutes: Readout

# Group Topics

* [Peer review process](review.html): In most cases, peer review is a
  30 second skim. In most cases, there are no incentives for doing a
  good job. Famous computer-generated and made-up papers have been
  accepted into credible venues, and agreement between reviewers is
  minimal.
* [Statistical Significance](significant.html): A bit over a decade
  ago, John Ioannidis showed that most scientific results are wrong,
  due to the way we use confidence intervals.
* [Mutual Admiration Society](admiration.md). Researchers in fixed
  fields write letters of recommendation for each other, cite each
  others' papers, review each others' papers, and include or exclude
  individuals into their fields. Thereau called this a mutual
  admiration society. Today, it is called an echo chamber, and
  conflicting voices are excluded from the discourse.
* [Science Reporting](reporting.html). Did you know chocolate is
  healthy? There is a selection process by which results go from
  science to popularization, whether through books or articles. It is
  rarely based on the quality of the research.
* [Understanding What Came Before](prior-work.html). Academics are, in
  many ways, disincentivized to read previous work, and incentivized
  to operate in silos.
* [Scientific Standards](standards.html).
