# What is this?

This is a web site for a session I am organizing for the April 2017
Day of Action at MIT. I am running an activity with several goals.

The high level goal is for participants to learn *How to Influence
Organizations*. Did you know that Cambridge helped Trump win the
election? Westboro Babtist Church has done more to forward LGBT rights
than most liberal groups? Anti-America protests in the Middle East
helped fuel sentiment in America for interventions. In many cases,
change tactics have the opposite effects from those intended by their
participants, or no effect at all. Effective change tactics require
understanding the parties involved, their motivations, and predicting
the effects of our actions. Otherwise, you simply mobilize the
opposition. This three-part series explores frameworks for effecting
organizational change, and concrete steps we can take which directly
lead to change.

It is helpful to learn theory in the context of application. We will
specifically look at this in the context of bad science. Specifically,
we will look at several ways in which incentives in the scientific
establishment lead to bad science, and investigate what we can do
about it.

This is a github page. This means you are seeing everything I am
working on in realtime. Depending on when you look at this page, it
may or may not reflect the final session.

# Problem Statement

According to Pew, roughly half of the US population does not believe
in human-caused climate change. The public has developed a healthy
distrust of science. As much as we might deny it, much of this
skepticism is justified. Science, especially as presented in K-12
classrooms, popular press, and popular books, is quite often quite
wrong. When we talk about issues like climate change, we're like the
boy who cried wolf. In this session, we will explore incentives in the
scientific establishment, and how we get so much wrong. Time
permitting, we will try to come up with ways to improve the incentives
within the scientific establishment.

# Session Structure

Primarily, we will break up into small groups. Each group would focus
on one topic. The currently planned topics are:

* Selection of academics: Thereau called the concept here a mutual
  admiration society, and today, it is called an echo chamber
* Peer review process: A 30 second skim, in many cases. No incentives
  for doing a good job. Famous computer-generated and BS papers
  accepted
* P-values and lack of reporting of null results. Famous John
  Ioannidis paper.
* Lack of incentives around errors
* Incentives for promotion/popular promotion for academics and
  universities
* Incentives for science reporters/popular book publishers
* Secret science

# Tentative session schedule

* 15 minutes: Overview of session, overview of frameworks of
  organizational change
* 30 minutes: Break into groups. Each group prepares a 5 minute minute
  presentation about their problem
* 30 minutes: Group presentations
* 10 minutes: Readout
