# Popular Science Reporting

Consider:

* Incentives for promotion/popular promotion for academics and
  universities with respect to press coverage
* Incentives for science reporters/popular book publishers for
  what to write stories on, and what to publish

As one might expect, there is a strong filter for overstatement of
results, grandstanding, unqualified results, and controversy.

As might be expected, constant flip-flopping on issues such as diet
undermines people's view of the scientific results as facts. This
volatility of reported facts translates into skeptical views on
evolution, global warming, vaccinces, and similar issues where science
is relatively conclusive.

Indeed, even within those fields, dishonest reporting undermines the
credibility of science. We see articles disproving older predictions
of global warming, where academics sought coverage by overstating
results.

This gives a genuine reason to distrust scientists as an authority.

Consider how we might address issues around science reporting and
publicity, both with regards to newspaper reporting, and with regards
to popular articles.
