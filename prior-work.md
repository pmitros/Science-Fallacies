In the 1980s, a popular technique in education was education
differentiated to students' learning styles. It was believed that
different students learned better auditorially, visually, or
kinesthetically.

However, over the following decades, there was no research support for
learning styles existing. Eventually, several metastudies came out
which [debunked learning
styles](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/PSPI_9_3.pdf). However,
papers continue to come out, oblivious to this work.

In the space of MOOCs, a significant portion of papers start out with
one of several assumptions:

* Dropout rate
* Videos+multiple choice questions
