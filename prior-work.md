# Understanding prior work

In the 1980s, a popular technique in education was education
differentiated to students' learning styles. It was believed that
different students learned better auditorially, visually, or
kinesthetically.

Over the following decades, there was no evidence for learning
styles. Eventually, several metastudies came out which [debunked
the concept of learning
styles](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/PSPI_9_3.pdf).

However,
[papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=learning+styles+&as_ylo=2013)
describing technologies to support different learning styles continue
to come out, oblivious to this work, and generally repeating
methodological errors described in such work.

In MOOCs (the space where I operate) a significant number of papers
begin with one of two faulty assumptions:
* In the early days of MOOCs, there was a mischaracterization of the
drop-out rate in MOOCs.
* State-of-the-art in MOOCs is hour-long videos and multiple choice
questions (which was often the state-of-the-practice, due to failure
to scale best practices, but was never the state-of-the-art).

Many such papers were simply incorrect. For example, many papers
attempted to improve on drop-out by adding interventions late in the
course, where most of the cited drop-out came from users simply not
logging in, or not making it past the first few minutes after logging
in. Many such papers added interventions which were either already
used in state-of-the-art MOOCs, or both more difficult to scale and
less effective than techniques in state-of-the-art MOOCs.

Neither the reviewers nor the authors from general ed-tech conferences
were aware of the issue. For a while, a few people from Harvard played
wack-a-mole with such work. This approach did not work -- rebuttals
are rarely read, and misconceptions continue to propagate. Indeed,
such papers began to cite each other.

This occurs in new fields of research, cross-disciplinary work, or
fields of research large enough that reviewers will not be familiar
with all prior work.

For the most part, researchers who ignore prior work can:

* Make greater claims about the impact of their own work
* Have more time for research. 

In a competitive landscape, such researchers tend to win.
