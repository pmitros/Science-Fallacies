# Understanding prior work

**Example 1**: In the 1980s, a popular technique in education was
targetting students' learning styles. Educators believed that
different students learned better if information were presented in an
auditory, visual, or kinesthetic way. However, over the following
decades, there was no evidence for learning styles. Eventually,
several meta-studies came out which [debunked the concept of learning
styles](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/PSPI_9_3.pdf). However,
[papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=learning+styles+&as_ylo=2013)
describing technologies to support different learning styles continue
to come out, oblivious to such work, and generally repeating
methodological errors in prior work.

**Example 2**: In MOOCs (the space where I operate) a significant
number of papers -- more than 10 percent -- begin with one of two
faulty assumptions:

* In the early days of MOOCs, there was a mischaracterization of the
drop-out rate in MOOCs due to some poor press management.
* State-of-the-art in MOOCs is hour-long videos and multiple choice
questions (which was often the state-of-the-practice, due to failure
to scale best practices, but was never the state-of-the-art).

Many such papers are simply incorrect. Many attempt to improve on
drop-out by adding interventions late in the course. By that point,
most of the alleged "drop-out" has happened (users never logging in,
or only logging in for a few minutes). Many papers also introduce
interventions which are either already used in state-of-the-art MOOCs,
or less effective than techniques used in state-of-the-art MOOCs.

Peer reviewers and authors from general ed-tech conferences do not
have enough background to catch such errors; there are no incentives
for them to check prior work. For a while, a few people from Harvard
played whack-a-mole with such work. This approach did not work --
rebuttals were rarely read, and misconceptions continued to propagate
from paper to paper.

These examples are the tip of the iceberg. Many MOOC papers
unknowningly replicate prior results in education research, or
incorrectly contradict based on well-known methodological errors.

For the most part, researchers who ignore prior work can:

* Make greater claims about the impact of their own work
* Have more time for research. 

In a competitive landscape, such researchers tend to win.

For your presentation:

* Summarize the problem
* Summarize the key parties and incentives involved
* Describe an approach to address the problem
