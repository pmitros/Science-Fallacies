# Mutual Admiration Society 

The term *mutual admiration society* is attributed to Thoreau, and was
popularized by the 1956 Broadway musical *Happy Hunting*. It refers to
a group of people who mutually respect and promote each other. In the
Web 2.0 era, this term was largely replaced with the term
*groupthink*. Your group will explore how this concept feeds into how
academia is structured, and how to fix it. Diversity in academia has
grown based on the protected classes (race, ethnicity, gender, etc.),
but there has been very little progress in terms of different points
of view. For example, a recent (informal) survey found that, of dozens
of people surveyed at MIT and Harvard, zero had voted for Trump. A
more broad paper found that (todo: evengalical Christian survey)
(todo: socioeconomic survey). (todo: academics with non-traditional
backgrounds)

Curiously, despite the focus on diversity, the diversity of ideas and
ideologies remains very low in elite academia.

# Task

Read [this popular article on
spanking](https://news.utexas.edu/2016/04/25/risks-of-harm-from-spanking-confirmed-by-researchers).

Now, read the original paper.

* Do you agree with the conclusion?
* Could you comment on the conclusion?
* Were you able to even read the paper?

If you weren't able to find a copy online, please ask me. Most
scientific results are published in proprietary journals, hidden from
public scrutiny, and only available to peers. This particular paper
could not even be accessed through MIT Libraries.

In the academy, existing professors:

* Write reference letters for jobs
* Hire new academics
* Peer review papers

Research communities are self-perpetuating. They are *extremely*
self-perpetuating at the tenure level, where one upset letter writer
can tank a tenure case.

As a result, it is often impossible to find jobs in new fields, old
fields stick around well past their usefulness, but in this group, we
will explore a different aspect: politics and culture. 

In the social sciences, such communities have underlying assumptions
and taboos which cannot be questioned.

In this case, the community
reached the (reasonable, but unproven) consensus that spanking harms
children. The study was run with the stated goal of validating this
belief: "there is a need for definitive conclusions about the
potential consequences of spanking for children"

The press coverage associated with the reflects that goal. 

What I concluded from the study is -- unsurprisingly -- that parents
who follow guidelines from organizations such as the American Academy
of Pediatrics have better results. Following such guidelines is a good
idea.
