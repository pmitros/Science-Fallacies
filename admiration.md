The study did not support the conclusion: "Risks of Harm from Spanking Confirmed by Analysis of Five Decades of Research." While this is the goal of the study (which itself states that it was done since the authors believe "there is a need for definitive conclusions about the potential consequences of spanking for children" -- which, as a goal for a study, contradicts the scientific method even at a high-school level), the study draws a much softer conclusion, with plenty of caveats.

What I concluded from the study is -- unsurprisingly -- that parents who follow guidelines from organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics have better results, and that following such recommendations is a good idea. Of course, reasonable people may disagree on specific guidelines, or how to balance such guidelines against each other where conflicts come up.

The problem with such reporting on studies, broadly speaking, is:
It undermines people's faith in science. Due to overreporting of results, people increasingly view science as an unreliable authority which changes its opinion regularly. This translates into views on evolution, global warming, diet, and similar. Indeed, we see articles debunking global warming, since data from today contradicts predictions published in similar articles a decade ago. While the studies were honest, but reporting on them was dishonest. This gives a genuine reason to distrust scientists as an authority.
It translates into bad policy. Where not using spanking is a great, evidence-based guideline for parents to follow, such studies and reporting translate into government policy. This translates into issues such as custody and similar, where one would normally follow higher standards of evidence.
It translates into discrimination. Use of spanking has strong correlations with ethnicity. 
One fine-grained suggestion I might add would be to avoid the coarse grouping of US/non-US. In particular, almost all methodological errors in the US would apply in most EU countries. They would not apply to a place like Ghana, where spanking is accepted as the mainstream practice.
