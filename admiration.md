# Mutual Admiration Society 

The term *mutual admiration society* is attributed to Thoreau, and was
popularized by the 1956 Broadway musical *Happy Hunting*. It refers to
a group of people who mutually respect and promote each other. In the
Web 2.0 era, this term introduced for this is *groupthink*.

Your group will explore how academia is structured to support
groupthink, and approaches to fix it. Diversity in academia are based
on the protected classes (race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation,
etc.), but there has been very little progress in terms of
intellectual diversity and respect for different points of view.

Many members of our communities have never really interacted with half
of the nation. A
[paper](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html)
found that at Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, Penn and Brown, more
students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the
entire bottom 60 percent. The two highest-growth religious groups --
Evangalical Christianity and resurgent Islam -- have virtually no
representation in elite academia. [Fewer than
1%](http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Gross_Simmons.pdf) of professors
at elite universities are born-again Christians. Furthermore, the
academy excludes not just anyone with any background without large
numbers of publications (e.g. industry, government, or otherwise, no
matter how good), but most disciplines hire into a very narrow set of
subfields (for example, computer science operates on a bucket
system). Within [Harvard's student
body](http://harvardmagazine.com/2017/05/harvards-class-gap), there
was an 80/6 split in favor of Clinton over Trump. Within the faculty,
anecdotally, the split was close to 100/0.

Hence, curiously, despite the focus on diversity, the diversity of
ideas and ideologies remains very low in elite academia. Academic
fields often become increasingly narrow and ideological with time.

# Task

Skim [this popular article on
spanking](https://news.utexas.edu/2016/04/25/risks-of-harm-from-spanking-confirmed-by-researchers).

Now, skim the original paper.

* Do you agree with the conclusion?
* Could you comment on the conclusion?
* Were you able to even read the paper?

If you weren't able to find a copy online, please ask me. Most
scientific results are published in proprietary journals, hidden from
public scrutiny, and only available to peers. This particular paper
could not even be accessed through MIT Libraries.

In the academy, established professors:

* Write reference letters for jobs
* Hire new academics
* Peer review papers

Research communities are, in effect, self-perpetuating. They are
*extremely* self-perpetuating at the tenure level, where one upset
letter writer can tank a tenure case. Consequently, it is generally
impossible to find jobs in new fields, old fields stick around well
past their usefulness, but in this group, we will explore a different
aspect: politics and culture.

In hard sciences and engineering, this problem generally just leads to
important problems being ignored (in computer science, for example,
anything which falls outside of the buckets). However, in the
humanities and social sciences, such communities generally have
underlying ideologies, assumptions, and taboos which cannot be
questioned.

A paper which supports a conservative point of view will, at the very
least, be given much more scrutiny in the peer review process, and an
academic with a conservative point of view will, likewise, at the very
least, have much more scrutiny when applying for academic
positions. Given the competitiveness of the process, the extreme
splits we see are unsurprising.

In the case of this study, the community reached the (reasonable, but
unproven) consensus that spanking harms children. The study was run
with the stated goal of validating this belief: "there is a need for
definitive conclusions about the potential consequences of spanking
for children," and the press coverage reflected that goal.

My conclusion from the study is -- unsurprisingly -- that parents who
follow guidelines from organizations such as the American Academy of
Pediatrics have better results. Following such guidelines is a good
parenting practice, but individual guidelines are hardly
scientifically proven to the level shown in the press coverage.

Your problem is to consider:

* What are the issues in selection of academics and academic papers?
* How would we address these issues, and allow science and evidence
  to emerge free of ideology?

Think about the key players, incentives, and what one would
realistically need to do to shift them.
